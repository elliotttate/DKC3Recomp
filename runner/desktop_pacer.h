 * cadence. A display lock runs one emulated frame every ticks_per_frame
 * ticks, so a 60-Hz display shows every frame once and a 120-Hz display
 * shows every frame twice, each frame landing on the same phase of the
 * refresh. The small difference between that cadence and the cartridge's
 * 60.0988 Hz is absorbed by audio rate control. A tick rate that would
 * leave the frame rate further than the tolerance from native cannot be
 * locked, and the caller keeps pacing on its own clock. */
