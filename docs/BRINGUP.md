# DKC3 bring-up log

## 2026-09-03 - repository created, first generation, the game boots

Scaffolded from DKC2Recomp the way DKC1Recomp was: the generic host
modules under `runner/` (SDL2/OpenGL presenter, launcher and overlay,
input, rewind, diagnostics, the macOS menu, display-link pacing and audio
rate control) were copied with the game prefix renamed; the game adapter,
the video module, the headless main, the ingester, the build, and the
documents are new. `snesrecomp` is pinned to upstream `mstan/snesrecomp`
main (`c2f2421`) through the `elliotttate/snesrecomp` fork's
`dkc3-bringup` branch, which adds only two missing includes (`<time.h>`
in `interp816.c`, `sdd1.h` in `interp_bridge.c`) that a strict C11 build
on macOS needed. `recomp-ui` is pinned as in DKC2Recomp (`ad2f3e2`).

### Supported ROM

Headerless DKC3 USA (En,Fr), 4 MiB, HiROM with FastROM (`$31`), SRAM 2 KiB,
SHA-256 `2277a2d8dddb01fe5cb0ae9a0fa225d42b3a11adccaeafa18e3c339b3794a32b`.
Vectors from the header: reset `$00:80C4`, native NMI `$00:CA45`, native IRQ
`$00:CA6E`. The NMI saves the registers and jumps through the frame pointer
at direct-page `$4A` rather than returning, the same non-returning frame
dispatcher DKC2 uses, so the adapter runs the handler and its
continuation to the next quiescent wait exactly as the DKC1 and DKC2
adapters do.

### Bank configuration

The H4v0c21 DKC3 disassembly (`bed9689`, 2025-08-01) is the same format
family as the H4v0c21 DKC2 disassembly that fed DKC2Recomp, so
`tools/ingest_dkc3_disasm.py` reuses the DKC2 importer in the snesrecomp
submodule for entry harvesting and cfg writing, converts the disassembly's
asar no$sns symbol file (27,126 labels) to the importer's WLA form, builds
the direct-call overlay from the sources' JSR/JSL operands (1,994 targets,
3 unresolved), and adds two collectors of its own: `JMP/JSR (table,x)`
sites whose table is a symbolic `dw` list, and labelled data blocks in the
code banks bounded by the next label. The DKC2 importer's own contract
collectors are DKC2-specific (their RAM addresses) and harvest nothing
here.

Result: 4,716 bounded function entries across banks `$80`, `$AC`,
`$B2`-`$B9`, `$BB`, `$BC`, `$BE`, `$BF`; 353 indirect dispatch contracts
with 2,274 targets (two sites skipped for having no symbolic table); 540
data regions. Sites that read a pointer from RAM (`JMP ($0042)`,
`JMP ($004A)`, and the like) carry no contract and run on the interpreter.

### First generation (native analyzer)

```
analysis: 4725 roots -> 4757 exact variants, 14041 edges
analysis: 3034 AOT-eligible, 1723 LLE-only
v2_emit: 15 bank(s) emitted in 5.03s
```

3,930 translation units, 61 MB of C. The 1,723 interpreter-only variants
are the next coverage target; raising them means the same leaf work DKC1
and DKC2 needed (dispatch contracts at the RAM-pointer sites, bounds at
unproven callees).

### The game runs

A 4,801-frame headless run at native size completed with no interpreter
stop and no runtime failure: 4,258 video-active frames, 4,329 audio-active
frames, 362 state transitions, and 1.2 s of wall time per 900 frames. The
captured frames show the Rare rolling-log logo with the "Nintendo presents"
barrel organ, the Dixie Kong's Double Trouble title with Kiddy and Dixie on
the hovercraft, the Northern Kremisphere map, and the attract-mode demo in
Lakeside Limbo with both Kongs, a Kobble, bananas, a bear coin, and the
timer HUD, then the loop back to the logo. Three independent 3,000-frame
runs produced identical frame, WRAM, VRAM, CGRAM, OAM, and audio hashes.

### What is and is not verified

- Verified: headless boot, title, map, and attract demo at native size;
  determinism across runs; the unit tests for the carried-over host
  modules, the ingester, and the pacing-log tool.
- The macOS app (`build/macos/DKC3Recomp.app`, ad-hoc signed) builds from
  the same sources with the DKC2Recomp SDL host. Its four hidden smoke
  tests pass: a 180-frame run exercising the overlay, rewind, and
  fast-forward; a 90-frame 16:10 run; a 90-frame quick-save save-and-load
  run; and the 600-frame headless boot. The unit suite is 14 of 14: the
  eleven host-module tests carried over from DKC2Recomp, the launcher
  defaults, the ingester, and the pacing-log tool.
- Two snesrecomp tests are deliberately not wired in at this pin: the
  submodule's `interp816` test fails its two page-cross cycle checks
  (upstream `cbcd323` expects 6 cycles for an indexed read that crosses a
  page; the runtime counts 5), and its bridge test calls
  `tier2_capture_set_default_enabled`, which the runtime no longer
  declares. Both are upstream test-versus-runtime drift, not DKC3
  behaviour; the DKC2 fork pin's older `interp816` test passes.
- Three things a build on this machine needed that DKC2Recomp's CMake
  supplied elsewhere: the C linkage block in the DKC3 headers the C++
  overlay includes, the recomp-ui include path for the input test, and the
  input tests' fixture arguments.
- Not verified: gameplay under real input, saves, the Windows host (copied
  but not built here), and every wide aspect beyond "the native frame
  between black margins".
- No widescreen terrain reconstruction exists for DKC3 yet. DKC2Recomp's
  presentation, HDMA band classification, and level-map decoding are
  DKC2-specific and were deliberately not copied; DKC3 needs its own
  evidence before any of that is attempted.

### Launcher recognition

The first app build's launcher reported "ROM not recognized": the
carried-over launcher record still held DKC2's SHA-256 and CRC32 and its
"USA v1.0" label. The record now carries DKC3's SHA-256, CRC32
`448EEC19`, and "USA (En,Fr)"; the recomp-ui model marks a ROM recognized
when the CRC matches and the hash is in the known list, so both were
needed. The boxart card is the generated placeholder.

## 2026-09-03 - lockup after Wrinkly: a number printer that rewrites its stack

- **Symptom:** the app locked up or stopped after the first visit to
  Wrinkly's Save Cave. Its report named the stop at frame 2385 with the
  resume PC at `$80:FFC0`, the cartridge header, and its tier-2 manifest
  showed the real event earlier: a call chain through `$80:9507`, `$80:953C`,
  `$80:9F53`, `$80:A1AA`, `$80:A20A`, `$80:A2D1`, an RTS treated as a
  dispatch at `$80:A696` to `$80:A64D`, then 19,002 hits of a jump from
  `$00:0005` to `$00:0000`. Because DKC3's NMI is a non-returning frame
  dispatcher, the game kept drawing frames while its main thread spun at
  address zero, which is why it looked like a hang before the stop.
- **Cause:** `CODE_80A65F`, the routine that prints a number as digits,
  pops its own return address into `$22`, divides the value by ten in a
  loop pushing each remainder, then re-pushes the address and returns to
  `CODE_80A64A`, which pops the pushed digits into the tilemap. A
  recompiled `CODE_80A64A` and an interpreted `CODE_80A65F` disagree
  about that stack, and the caller's return address is gone. It is the
  only `LDA/PHA/RTS` re-push in the game; 119 labels are followed by a
  pull, but those are register restores and loop heads.
- **Fix:** `tools/ingest_dkc3_disasm.py` now emits `force_lle` for both
  routines with the reason beside each, so regeneration keeps them on the
  interpreter and the whole stack dance is interpreted; the surrounding
  recompiled code calls in and returns through the runtime's normal bridge.
  The generation moved by one variant (3,033 proven, 1,722 interpreted).
- **Verified:** a 6,401-frame scripted headless run with the user's SRAM
  starts a file, enters the cave, presses through the dialogue, reaches the
  save summary that prints the times and percentages, chooses from the
  save menu, returns to the map, and re-enters, with 21 interpreted calls
  into the printer and no address-zero or off-header site in the manifest.
  The earlier headless boot never showed the fault because its script
  stopped pressing at the first dialogue page. The same script against the
  pre-fix configuration is recorded below when its build has run.
- The SRAM the app wrote holds only the game's fill pattern; no file was
  saved before the failure, and the pattern also selects French in the
  file select, which is the game's reading of that SRAM, not a bug here.
